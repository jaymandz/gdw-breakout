# gdw-breakout

Inspired by this old-ass [StackExchange post](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/854/what-are-good-games-to-earn-your-wings-with), here's my attempt at creating a Breakout clone!

_You need to have Python 3.11 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) installed in your computer first._

After cloning this repo, run the following command to set everything up:

```shell
$ poetry update
```

Then run this to start the game:

```shell
$ poetry run python breakout.py
```

Enjoy!
