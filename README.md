# gdw-breakout

Inspired by this old-ass [StackExchange post](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/854/what-are-good-games-to-earn-your-wings-with), here's my attempt at creating a Breakout clone!

_You need to have Python 3.11 and [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) installed in your computer first._

After cloning this repo, run the following command to set everything up:

```shell
$ pipenv update
```

_Windows users will need to download_ `pygame‑2.1.2‑cp311‑cp311‑win_amd64.whl` _from [this website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame) first before running this command. I'm not putting it in this repo because it's not mine._

Then run this to start the game:

```shell
$ pipenv run python ./breakout.py
```

Enjoy!
